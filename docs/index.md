## Project Abstract: 
        The impact of climate change in the Western US, particularly in Idaho, calls for the need of a portal 
        where residents can easily get information on climate-related health issues near them. Understanding climate 
        health effects involves a portal where residents can see the nature and duration of climate extremes, 
        exposure levels, population sensitivity, green areas, and community resilience. Idaho lacks this accessible 
        information on climate-related health issues which hinders the availability of information that public policy 
        makers need and outreach efforts for residents facing these issues.
        
        To address this problem we propose a web-based application called Healthy Idaho which will contain climate-related 
        health data specific to Idaho’s census tracts. The portal will provide information on heat waves and wildfire smoke 
        exposure across different regions, land surface temperature, access to adaptation measures, and relevant social background 
        information. The portal will have a map segmented based on Idaho’s census tracts which makes it easy for users to see the 
        climate-related health information near them. By providing Idahoans with region-specific climate resources, the portal 
        facilitates informed decision making to understand and act on health risks.
